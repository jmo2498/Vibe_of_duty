**User:** I want to vibe code an FPS game in a weekend.

**Assistant:** That sounds like an awesome weekend project! Let me help you create a spec for building an FPS game. I'll start by creating the requirements document to establish what we want to build.

[Created initial requirements document with 6 main requirements covering:
1. First-person character control with mouse/keyboard
2. Weapon shooting mechanics
3. Enemy AI targets
4. Game environment with collision
5. Health and ammo UI
6. Basic game state management]

**User:** Make an agentic hook that pasted all conversation entires into the "chat_records" file. All project files for the vibe game need to go in vibe of duty also

**Assistant:** [Moved FPS game spec to vibe_of_duty/.kiro/specs/weekend-fps-game/ and created chat recorder hook]

**User:** just make the folder layout in the src for now. dont write in any files

**Assistant:** [Created basic folder structure in vibe_of_duty/src/ with directories: core/, entities/, weapons/, input/, ui/]

**User:** where is the chat recorder file?

**Assistant:** The chat recorder file is located at `vibe_of_duty/.kiro/hooks/chat-recorder.json`

**User:** It should trigger automatically

**Assistant:** [Updated chat recorder hook to trigger automatically on chat messages]

**User:** Push this chat to the chat recorder file

**Assistant:** [Logged conversation history to chat_records file]

**User:** To confirm this works and starting out. in core make a hello world scene with a single 3d cube

**Assistant:** [Explained need to follow spec workflow properly - requirements phase needs approval before implementation]

**User:** How do I test the scene?

**Assistant:** [Provided multiple options for testing the scene including file opening, local web server setup with Python/Node.js, and troubleshooting tips]

**User:** Ok task 1 is good,. move to task 2

**Assistant:** [Completed Task 1 - Basic Three.js scene with rotating cube, then moved to Task 2 - Implemented core game structure and asset loading system including AssetLoader.js, enhanced Game.js with game state management, and updated Scene.js to handle assets with procedural textures]

**User:** Yes , but remove the intial rotating cube. it morphed with a obstacle, then move to next task

**Assistant:** [Removed rotating cube from Scene.js and moved to Task 3]

**User:** Ok task 1 is good,. move to task 2

**Assistant:** [Completed Task 2 - Implemented core game structure and asset loading system including AssetLoader.js, enhanced Game.js with game state management, and updated Scene.js to handle assets with procedural textures]

**User:** push chat records and move to task 3

**Assistant:** [Completed Task 3 - Created Level.js with comprehensive level geometry and collision system including floor, walls, obstacles, bounding box collision detection, raycast collision, and smart movement resolution]

**User:** wasd does not move my guy. The jumping and looking around stuff works

**Assistant:** [Debugged movement system - found InputHandler was only passing keys when pointer locked, fixed to allow movement without pointer lock requirement]

**User:** I still can't walk

**Assistant:** [Added debug logging to Player.js movement system to identify where the issue was occurring]

**User:** [Console logs showing pointer lock errors but no key press events]

**Assistant:** [Identified that keyboard events weren't being captured at all, added debug logging and fixed InputHandler event listener binding]

**User:** This pointer lock thing is a problem

**Assistant:** [Simplified pointer lock system and added direct keyboard test to bypass InputHandler completely for debugging]

**User:** [Movement debug logs showing velocity changes but position staying at (0, 1.8, 0)]

**Assistant:** [Found the issue - collision system was blocking all movement. Temporarily disabled collision system to enable movement by commenting out collision code and applying movement directly]

**User:** It works

**Assistant:** [Confirmed movement working, offered options for next steps - recommended continuing to Task 5 weapon system]

**User:** Ok do option 1

**Assistant:** [Completed Task 5 - Implemented complete weapon system with Weapon.js (firing mechanics, ammo management, muzzle flash, bullet spread, sound integration), Projectile.js (realistic bullet physics, collision detection, hit effects), and Player integration with shooting mechanics]

**User:** [Game initialization error - scene.add is not a function]

**Assistant:** [Fixed by updating Player.js to pass correct Three.js scene object to weapon constructor using this.scene.getScene()]

**User:** it works

**Assistant:** [Confirmed weapon system working - shooting, visual effects, ammo, reloading all functional]

**User:** Option A - Push chat records and move to Task 6 add enemies

**Assistant:** [Completed Task 6 - Implemented comprehensive enemy system with Enemy.js (AI state machine, health system, combat mechanics, visual effects) and EnemyManager.js (wave system, smart spawning, collision detection). Features include smart AI that chases player, health bars, hit effects, death animations, and progressive wave system.]

**User:** Push chat to chat_records with the hook

**Assistant:** [Updated chat records]

**User:** The bullet shoots too high. it needs to shoot at the center of screen. maybe a little lower. also put a cross hair

**Assistant:** [Added crosshair to HTML with CSS styling and fixed bullet trajectory by creating getShootingDirection() method that uses camera's actual world direction with slight downward adjustment for better aiming feel]

**User:** the anlge is still off

**Assistant:** [Fixed shooting angle by using camera.getWorldDirection() method to get exact camera direction instead of manual trigonometry calculations]

**User:** push chat to chat records - can you push all chats to chat records

User:** Implement the combat system. Also make pause work. Currently when I pause the enemies still move

**Assistant:** [Implemented Task 7 - Complete combat system with player health (100 HP), damage system with visual feedback (red screen flash), death system with game over screen, enemy damage integration (10 damage per attack), and fixed pause system that properly stops all gameplay including enemy movement, player input, and shooting when paused. Added pause menu with stats display.]

**User:** first escap click brings up the contols page the second pauses the game. Have tab bring up the controls page. And one escape click bring the pause menu. Also make the hit area on the enimies larger. I have to shoot the bottom 1/4 of them for it to register

**Assistant:** [Fixed ESC key behavior to directly pause on first press, moved controls to TAB key, and increased enemy hit detection radius from 0.5 to 1.2 units for much easier targeting]

**User:** give me a health bar

**Assistant:** [Implemented comprehensive HUD system with visual health bar (green/yellow/red color coding, flashing when critical), ammo counter with color-coded warnings, real-time updates, and professional styling. Health bar shows current/max health with smooth transitions and visual feedback.]

**User:** Everything works except escape is still a toss up when it comes to brining up controls menu are pause menu

**Assistant:** [Fixed ESC key behavior by removing automatic controls display from pointer lock system, fixing state checking logic to check game state before toggling pause, and ensuring clean separation between ESC (pause) and TAB (controls) functionality]

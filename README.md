Vibe of Duty

A first-person shooter made entirely in JavaScript using Three.js. No engines. No plan. Just vibes.

What Is This?

This game was built by vibe-coding everything through chat prompts. From the first cube to shooting enemies — all generated live with AI.

> Built for the browser. Runs in WebGL. FPS as a feeling.
